	<class>Input Validation</class>
	<severity>High</severity>

	<impact>Untrustworthy data that is external in origin is possibly being output by the server to clients without adequate filtering.</impact>
	<impact>Consequently, it may be possible for a third-party to inject malicious script code that runs in the context of another user visiting the server.</impact>
	<impact>This code would be able to manipulate the DOM of the target user and, potentially, the cookie set by the server.</impact>
	<impact>The precise impact depends greatly on the application.</impact>
	<impact>XSS is generally a threat to web applications which have authenticated users or are otherwise security sensitive.</impact>
	<impact>Malicious code may be able to manipulate the content of the site, changing its appearance and/or function for another user.</impact>
	<impact>This includes modifying the behavior of the web application (such as redirecting forms, etc).</impact>
	<impact>The code may also be able to perform actions within the application without user knowledge.</impact>
	<impact>Script code can also obtain and retransmit cookie values if they haven't been set HttpOnly.</impact>

	<remediation>The developer must identify how the untrustworthy data is being output to the client without adequate filtering.</remediation>
	<remediation>There are various language/platform specific techniques for filtering untrustworthy data.</remediation>
	<remediation>General rules for preventing XSS can be found in the recommended OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet (see references).</remediation>

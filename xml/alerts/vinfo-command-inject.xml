  	<remediation>
		The developer should review the request and response against the code to manually verify whether or not a vulnerability is present.
  	</remediation>
	<remediation>
		The use of command execution functions (eg. "system()") using untrustworthy, external input should be strongly avoided.
	</remediation>
  	<remediation>
		Sanitizing input can prevent these vulnerabilities. Variables of string types should be filtered for escape characters.

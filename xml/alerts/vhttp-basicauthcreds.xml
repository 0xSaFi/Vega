	<impact>Vega has detected a link that includes HTTP Basic authentication credentials in scanned content.</impact>
	<impact>The exposure of these credentials may allow unauthorized access to server resources.</impact>

	<remediation>The link should be investigated by developers to determine if they are valid credentials and to assess the impact of their disclosure.</remediation>
	<remediation>The code or static content responsible for this disclosure should be corrected.</remediation>
	<remediation>The password should be changed.</remediation>

	<discussion>It's possible to define a URI that includes a password in the userinfo section of the URI, in the form of http://username:password@host. Browsers can support URI credentials for authenticating to both HTTP servers (via Basic authentication) and FTP servers. The inclusion of credentials in URIs is considered a security risk as these credentials can be left exposed to attackers and/or transmitted in the clear. Disclosure of credentials can lead to unauthorized access.
